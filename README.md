# Crypto Payments Vault Lottery

## Description
This project aims to provide incentive greater adoption of the of Crypto payments for online, and realworld payments. Typically debit and credit are subject to fees ranging 1-3%. With crypto using efficient layer 2s, or modern layer 1 chains, fees can be minimized. However, as consumers and merchants are already eating the cost of credit and debit fees in the name of convenience, these fees can be used in ways that benefit payers instead of large centralized banks and credit card companies. 

### Giving back to consumers and merchants
When transacting with crypto a small %fee from transactions can be added to a yield bearing vault contract following the ERC-4636 standard.  Once the vault reaches a preset total value, or a certain amount of time has elapsed, the value in the vault can be distributed in various mechanisms that benefit consumers and vendors instead of payment middle men. For example, a semi-random wallet selected (with odds of a wallet being selected proportional to the value contributed to the vault) can win a jackpot contain all, or a portion of the vault's value. 

This incentives users to pay with crypto, and further incentives merchants to accept crypto as a way of encouraging consumer spending, with more overall economic value be transferred back to consumers and actual vendors with out middle men. 

## Deploy



This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
